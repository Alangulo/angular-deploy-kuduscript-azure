# My Angular 6 App built and deployed to Azure Websites

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.1 initially and upgraded to Angular 6 later on.
The whole purpose of this repository is to demonstrating the CI/CD piple line only using Kudu script to build and deploy an Angular app to an Azure Website.
